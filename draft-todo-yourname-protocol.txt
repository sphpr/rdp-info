A Historical Analysis of Design Lessons from The Reliable Data Protocol

Abstract

   This document reviews and analyzes the history and experience of the
   Reliable Data Protocol (RDP).  RDP was initially published as an
   experimental protocol in RFC 908 in 1984 and subsequently revised in
   RFC 1151 in 19901.  RDP aimed to provide a message-oriented, reliable
   transport service to meet specific application requirements such as
   remote loading.  This document summarizes the key technical
   experiences gained from RDP's experimental deployment2, details the
   lessons learned regarding checksum performance and flow control
   mechanisms, and assesses the conceptual influence of its design
   principles on subsequent IETF transport protocols (e.g., TCP SACK and
   QUIC).  The document is intended for historical archiving, providing
   a reference for early explorations of Internet transport protocols,
   and does not propose any new standards or deployment recommendations.
